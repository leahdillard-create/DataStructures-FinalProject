Data Structures &amp; Starting Computing Final Projects 

Starting Computing Final Project-
  I created classesCatalog.cpp, which is essentially a login portal for a university that allows the user
  to login as a student or registrar with a username and password. The user is then able to access all student
  records as the registrar, and enroll in classes based on prerequisites as the student.
  
Data Structures Final Project-
  This final project was all about maximum efficiency in terms of runtime of particular data structures, namely
  bubblesort, doubly linked list, hash, and heap. By inserting a .csv file of 10,000 numbers, according to the 
  data structure, these numbers were sorted, inserted, and/or searched and compared. The data structure that
  was able to complete these tasks in the least amount of time was recorded.
