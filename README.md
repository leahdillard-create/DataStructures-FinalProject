# Data Structures
## Content Description
Attached are several files that include examples of multiple data structures and their functionalities, from linked lists to queue linked lists to hash tables. Also included is my final project folder, in which the contents are described below.
## Final Project Description
  This final project was all about maximum efficiency in terms of runtime of particular data structures, namely
  bubblesort, doubly linked list, hash, and heap. By inserting a .csv file of 10,000 numbers, according to the 
  data structure, these numbers were sorted, inserted, and/or searched and compared. The data structure that
  was able to complete these tasks in the least amount of time was recorded. There are multiple files attached which are used to compare the time complexity of many commonly used data structures along with a writeup including graphs on their efficiency.
