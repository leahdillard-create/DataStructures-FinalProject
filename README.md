# Data Structures Final Project
  This final project was all about maximum efficiency in terms of runtime of particular data structures, namely
  bubblesort, doubly linked list, hash, and heap. By inserting a .csv file of 10,000 numbers, according to the 
  data structure, these numbers were sorted, inserted, and/or searched and compared. The data structure that
  was able to complete these tasks in the least amount of time was recorded.
